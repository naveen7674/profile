            <b>Naveen Goud,Edgi</b> known as Naveen,
            <br><br>
            <p>I was born in Telangana,India.As a kid I spent quite a bit of time dabbling with
                my toys and other stuff. I found it exciting knowing about technology and with age grew
                my zeal to know more about them.</p>
            <p>My first day in school is a mixed bag of watered eyes and the surprises thrown by the
                alluring alien environment of the school. As days passed learning became the essence of my life.
                Math amazed me with its variety while science had its own share of surprises for me. Apart from
                academics
                my school played a vital role in my all-round development. I secured a CGPA of 8.5/10 in my 10th
                Standard.
                My fascination towards applied sciences drove me to take up a Intermediate and scored 91%. Admission to
                Undergraduate Engineering courses is through a highly competitive screening test among 300000 odd
                students.
                I came out with flying colors securing my place in the top 10% of the students. My Performance in the
                screening
                test put a surfeit of choices before me to choose my Engineering stream from. I opted for Information
                Technology
                as my major at MLR Institute of Technology, a reputed College known for its excellence in Technical
                education.
                This provided me an opportunity to delve deeper into the field of technology. I have consistently
                improved my
                performance by working hard in the technical subjects like java,python and with help from my professors
                managing
                to secure a percentage of 64.8%.</p>
            <p>I got placed in a software company as a web developer before completing my final
                semester itself,I completed my training with the company before completing my graduation and I
                was directly involved in the projects with the company after my graduation in the month of august
                2021,which it enabled me to improve my technique and application in various areas including C,PHP,
                JAVASCRIPT, HTML and CSS, XML, and MySQL,but that didn't gave me satisfaction on my technical skills,
                I wanted to improve my skills by completing my masters and then focus on jobs after completing
                my masters and also it is my dream to complete graduation from university in abroad,so I think
                this is correct time to complete my master which helps me in career to get good job in my field of
                interest. </p>
            <p>There is a saying that, “The only permanent thing in life is change”. This perfectly holds true to
                the world of Computer Science where novel ideas are not a novelty. It is this novelty that entices me to
                this
                field and gives me a deep sense of professional pride. In this context, I would like to pursue my
                graduation in
                Computer Science, which not only supplements the knowledge that I posses but also provides a strong
                platform
                for my future career goals. At the same time I want to introduce a new technology by integrating
                Computer
                Elements with Computer Technology. Attending different workshops and seminars related to Computer
                Sciences
                especially on Computer Design, and Web Development has aided me in understanding the utilitarian aspects
                of it,
                over the projects I worked on.</p>

            <p>Currently iam persuing my masters from University of Greewhich,London and looking forward to be a
                part of good organisation such that I get good opportunities to improve my skills.
            </p>
